This is the simple GUI that you need to fill out here are what the fields mean:
Steam API ID: This is the API key linked with your steam account you can register for one at this link: https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview/auth
BP.tf API ID Key: This is for backpack.tf which is a database / website that has prices for each item in the game. If the website is still active you will be able to get the key here: https://backpack.tf/developer
Starting Steam Profile ID: This is a ID that steam assigns your account with, this ID does not have to be yours but here is how to find it: https://support.nexon.net/hc/en-us/articles/360001118286-How-do-I-find-my-Steam-ID-
Levels of Search: This is how many levels you want this program to run. At 1 level the program will get the friends of all the people on the given ID's friend list then get each friendâ€™s friend list and go through and look up their inventory worth. At level 2 it will pick a friend on the ID's friend list at random and do the same thing again. Level 3 will do the same thing again ... and so on.
Minimum Value: This is the minimum value that you want a backpack to have. If you only want inventories at or over $300, put 300 in that box.
All the inventories found will be output in the SteamDB.accdb which is an access database file for those who do not know. I realize not everyone will have an access DB account but there are free accdb readers and this data can be imported into excel.
